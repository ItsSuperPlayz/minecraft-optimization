# Minecraft server optimization guide
## Before you read this...
Yes, this is a copy of [YouHaveTrouble's guide](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization). I did not make this guide myself.
This repository summarizes and reorders the aforementioned guide for all of you people who have no patience to read such long texts.

This guide applies for version 1.21+. Some things may still apply to 1.15 - 1.20.
